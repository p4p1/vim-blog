                     VIM - vim-blog pluggin

A simple vim pluggin for working on my blog. This pluggin does require a specific
project architecture and will need you to set global variables to specify some
important information. This pluggin will update a rss feed named blog.xml
located in the root of the blog in the rss folder. It will also edit a index
html file in the blog folder. This pluggin will search for this query to edit
thing. "<!-- INSERT NEW POST HERE -->"

      VARIABLES               DESCRIPTION
    g:blog_author          The name of the author of the blog
    g:blog_url             The url of the path where the posts are located

.vimrc:
    In your .vimrc you will also want to add this line to automate the update
    when you create a new file:
autocmd BufNewFile *.html call Blog_update_rss_html()


MORE INFO:
This script works on a html and rss template that I made if you wish to edit
this template look into the plugin folder of this pluggin and edit the vim_blog
file.
